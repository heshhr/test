        <h1>History of Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery</h1>
        <p>The earliest conservation and research initiative in Sri Lanka began in the beginning of 1978. 
            All seven species of sea turtles at the time were listed as being in risk of extinction. Of the seven species, 
            it was discovered that five of them frequently landed on Sri Lanka's southern coast beaches to deposit their eggs. 
            The people gathered these eggs and sold them in the open market.</p>
        <p>Around this time, Victor Hasselblad, a well-known Swedish camera manufacturer whose cameras were the first to be used on the moon, entered the scene. 
           Victor shared similar photographic interests to Dr. Upane de Zylva, a well-known Sri Lankan bird photographer, and the two were good friends. 
           Victor had donated money through Dr. Zylva for use in Sri Lankan conservation and research.</p>
        <p>Dr. Siri Wickremesinghe, who passed away, was a close friend of Dr. Zylva. Dr. Wickremesinghe and his companion agreed that a turtle conservation project 
           would be the most effective because they both had a love of nature and wild animals. Similiyas Abbrew, the father of Chandrasiri and the grandfather of Isuru, 
           just so happened to be a friend of Dr. Zylva's, and when he learned of their intended endeavor, he was more than willing to donate a portion of his land to 
           construct the hatchery. It all came together because Nape in Kosgoda was a favorite beach for turtles to deposit their eggs. 
           The turtles have found a secure habitat and are multiplying as a result of Victor Hasselblad, Dr. Zylva, and Dr. Wickremesinghe. 
           The hatchlings running to catch the first wave after being released on the shore is a magnificent sight to behold.</p>

                <p class="intro2">Of the seven living sea turtle species recorded in the world, five species were reported in the
                    coastal belt of Sri Lanka coming for nesting. The south and southwest coastline of Sri Lanka comprises
                    the largest marine turtle rookeries.</p>
